      <h1 class="title">Toxic Stress</h1>
      <p class= "article">Syria's children are overwhelmingly suffering "toxic stress" from the country's brutal civil war, with possible long-term effects on their psychological and physical health, a report by a children's welfare group concludes</p>
      <p class= "article">The report, which the British charity Save the Children published Tuesday, says that almost all children it interviewed say they suffer from war-related stress, brought on by bombings, the loss of family and friends, and near-constant insecurity.
      </p>
	    <p class = "article">At least 3 million Syrians under age 6 "know nothing but war," says Save the Children, which characterizes the conflict one of the biggest humanitarian crises since World War II.
      </p>
      <p class = "article">"My son wakes up afraid in the middle of the night," a father named Firas is quoted as saying about his 3-year-old son, Saaed.
      </p>
      <p class = "article">He wakes up screaming. This is how children have been affected. He has bad dreams and wakes up crying and sometimes runs out onto the street. He has nightmares because of the war and air bombardment. Because of fear. A child was slaughtered in front of him, so he started to dream that someone is coming to slaughter him. When a child witnesses a beheading, how could he not get afraid?"
